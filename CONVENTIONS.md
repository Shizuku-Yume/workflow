# Workflow Conventions

Shared rules for all `flow-*` skills. Each skill names the sections it needs;
read those, not the whole file.

**Precedence.** When rules disagree: the user's current instruction, then
`.workflow/standards.md` and the repository's existing conventions (commit style in
`git log`, lint and formatter config, CONTRIBUTING), then this file, then `STYLE.md`.

---

## 0. Evidence before questions

Before asking, check whether the codebase answers it. Current behaviour, patterns,
APIs, constraints, dependencies and configuration are yours to find: `grep`, read,
dispatch subagents. Ask the user only what they own: intent, preference, scope, risk
tolerance, acceptance criteria, and the choice between options that all work.

---

## 1. Decision protocol

### 1.1 Facts are yours to find
§0 applies: only decisions the user owns may interrupt them.

### 1.2 Triage before asking
Every open question goes into one bucket:

**A - Look it up** — facts, conventions, prior decisions (§2 says how to read them),
what APIs do.

**B - Decide it, log if it qualifies** — you can name the clearly better option, or
it has no real stakes. Write a decision entry when all three hold: the choice is
hard to reverse, someone reading the code later would wonder why, and a real
alternative lost. Missing any one, decide it silently and move on; routine naming
and formatting never qualify.

**C - Ask the user** — the answer changes what gets built and the trade-off is real.

### 1.3 Ask in batches
One round holds every question you can ask now without inventing answers to other
questions, at most 6. Format:
```
Q1 - <title>
   <question, 2-3 sentences>
   Options: A | B | C
   My pick: <one>, because <one line>
```

Rank by what blocks the most work. A question needing more than a screen hides a
smaller one.

### 1.4 Confirm before proceeding
Restate decisions as a numbered list for the user to correct or confirm. Silence is
not agreement.

### 1.5 Stop when unblocked
Stop grilling when no open decision would change the next step.

## 2. File structure

```
AGENTS.md                        workflow block points here
.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md   the steps
.agents/agents/<name>.md         review agents
.workflow/
  bin/workflow                   the CLI, committed with the project
  bin/workflow-core.py           validate and next (python3, stdlib only)
  CONVENTIONS.md                 this file

  technical-debt.md              architecture findings to address
  merge-strategy.md              branches, landing, claiming tasks
  phase-boundaries.md            continue, clear, compact or delegate
  spike-tasks.md                 exploratory work guidelines
  specs/<effort>.md              what to build, for an effort that has a spec
  tasks/<effort>/<NN>-<slug>.md  one task each, in its effort's directory
  maps/<slug>.md                 multi-session planning
  done/<effort>/                 archived tasks, plus retrospective.md written by flow-close
```

**Efforts and specs.** An effort is the slug that groups tasks (`tasks/<effort>/`,
`done/<effort>/`). Its optional spec is `specs/<effort>.md`, with this header:
```
**Status:** proposed | in progress | done
**Priority:** critical | high | normal | low
```
`Priority` is optional (default `normal`) and lives only in the spec header: `next`
ranks an effort's ready tasks by it, and a `Priority` on a task file does nothing
(`validate` says so). `urgent` is accepted as another name for `critical`. A typo
ranks as `normal`, so `validate` warns about a value it does not know. A lone bugfix,
spike or `maintenance` work needs no spec. Update a spec in place when code changes
its facts.

**Rules:**
- Run the CLI as `.workflow/bin/workflow <command>` from the project root. It is
  committed and needs nothing on PATH, so it works in every clone, CI and cloud agent.
- Read the files directly. Active work: `.workflow/bin/workflow next` (ready tasks by
  priority, plus paused and blocked ones) or `.workflow/tasks/`. Prior decisions: the
  newest entries at the end of `decisions.md`, plus `grep -n -i '<term>'
  .workflow/decisions.md` for the area you will touch (`grep -n 'Effort:\*\* <slug>'`
  for one effort). Debt: read or grep `technical-debt.md`.
- `standards.md` is the entry point. Keep it under one screen.
- **Planning documents get committed.** A skill that writes decisions, glossary,
  specs, maps or tasks commits them when it finishes, onto the main branch, before any
  task branch is cut; under `Landing: pr` they go through a PR. A task starts only once
  its task file is committed on the main branch.
- `decisions.md` defines its entry format at the top (five fields: `Decided`, `Instead
  of`, `Because`, `Mine`, `Revisit when`). Cite an entry by heading: `decisions.md:
  <date> - <title>`. The file is strictly append-only with one exception: a new entry
  that reverses an old one carries `**Supersedes:** <old heading>`, and the same change
  appends `**Superseded by:** <new heading>` to the old entry. A superseded entry is
  history: follow the pointer.
- `decisions.md` and `glossary.md` use git's union merge (`.gitattributes`), so
  parallel branches adding entries don't conflict.
- `technical-debt.md` is a flat list of findings, cited by heading, each kept until
  fixed or declined (§6).
- `merge-strategy.md` defines landing (`Landing:` in `standards.md`), claiming a task,
  and when dependents may start.
- **Dirty files at start.** When a task starts, run `git status --porcelain`: paths
  already modified or untracked belong to someone else. Record them in `## Progress`
  as `Dirty at start: <paths>` (or `none`) and keep them out of every commit; stage
  the task's own paths by name (`git add -- <paths>`). If the task needs one, ask.

### 2.1 Task files

`flow-break` drafts them, `flow-implement` builds and archives them. This is the
grammar `validate` enforces; `flow-verify`, `flow-start` and the planning skills need
the paths above, not this.

- Filename `tasks/<effort>/<NN>-<slug>.md`, heading `# <NN>: <Title>`. `NN` is unique
  within an effort; cite a task as `<effort>/<NN>`, at least two digits. Files
  directly under `tasks/` (pre-2.3 layout) still work; `git mv` them when convenient.
- Fields are `Name: value` lines, plain or bold (`**Effort:** <slug>`).
- Required (`validate` errors): `Effort` (slug `[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*`, same as the
  directory); `Blocked by` (`None`, or a comma list of `NN` or `<effort>/NN`,
  numbers only); `Check` (command and the result that means it works, or a
  `## Check` section).
- Expected from `flow-break`, not machine-checked: `Delivers`, `Files`, `Read
  first`, and the `Done when` checklist.
- `Task type:` (default `feature`) sets what the Check proves. `feature`, `bugfix`:
  it fails (or can't run yet) before the change and passes after. `refactor`:
  behaviour stays the same; it passes before and after, and review confirms no
  behaviour changed. `spike`: no Check-before; the deliverable is an answer
  (`spike-tasks.md`).
- Optional: `Base commit:` (placeholder when drafted, real SHA when started);
  `Started:`/`Finished:` (ISO 8601); `Status: active | paused | blocked` (§6);
  `Covers:` spec check IDs (`W1, W3`); `Base branch:` the unlanded blocker branch it
  was stacked on (`merge-strategy.md`).
- Sections: `## Progress` (dirty paths at start, Check result before the change,
  root cause, review findings and outcomes, pause handoff), `## Blocked` (§5),
  `## Findings` (spike answers).
- Inside `done/<effort>/` the same problems are only warnings.
- Archive the task to `done/<effort>/` in the same commit as its code and docs. A
  blocker archived in HEAD is finished: its dependents become ready unchanged.

After editing tasks or decisions, run `.workflow/bin/workflow validate`. Errors
block; fix the file, not the validator.

---

## 3. Writing

`.workflow/STYLE.md` covers everything a person reads: chat, documents, commits, comments,
UI text. The repository's own conventions win over it (Precedence, above).

---

## 4. Task sizing

**Trivial** — question, clarification, greeting. Answer directly.

**Hotfix** — all of these hold, else it is small or complex: users are affected by a
degraded or down system now; the fix is localized and well understood; waiting is
riskier than skipping process.

Hotfix path: skip grill, spec, break and verify; fix now and verify where the failure
was observed, or hand that check to the user. The
security pass (§7) still runs. Before the session ends, write both:

1. A decision entry in `.workflow/decisions.md`, headed `## <date> - Hotfix: <title>`:
   - **Decided:** the temporary fix applied
   - **Instead of:** the proper solution (or "unclear, needs investigation")
   - **Because:** why it couldn't wait
   - **Mine:** yes
   - **Revisit when:** the proper fix lands

   If it can't be written honestly, it wasn't a hotfix: reclassify.
2. The proper fix as a `Task type: bugfix` task (§8) in the effort owning the code,
   else `maintenance`, with `Read first` citing the hotfix entry by its heading. That
   open task is the tracker: `grep -rl 'Hotfix:' .workflow/tasks/` finds every open one,
   and `flow-start` reports them until they land.

**Small task** — all of these hold: a single behaviour change or bug fix; it affects
fewer than 3 modules' behaviour; requirements clear; no architectural decisions;
revertable in under 5 minutes. Impact radius matters more than file count: a core type
in 1 file used by 20 modules is not small. When unsure, it is complex.

Small tasks skip `flow-grill`, `flow-spec`, `flow-break` and `flow-verify`, and still
need reading the code, tests, proof and a commit message. Run the dirty-file check
(§2) first. A bug follows §8; the security pass (§7) still runs. Work without a task
file (small task or hotfix) lands as `merge-strategy.md` says.

The first classification is a guess. Before building, read the callers of what you
will change. While building, any one of these makes the task complex on the spot:

- a public interface, data shape, schema or persisted data has to change
- a new dependency is needed
- the change reaches a third module
- a third decision comes up, or one that changes what gets built

Stop, name the tripwire, keep the work (uncommitted or a named stash) as input to the
plan, and route through §5.

**Complex** — everything else: the full workflow from the earliest incomplete step.

---

## 5. Skill routing

This is the only routing table; `flow-start` and the skills point here.

| Situation | Skill |
|-----------|-------|
| Session start, context lost, or next step unclear | `flow-start` |
| Vague requirements, design questions, or "grill me" | `flow-grill` |
| Too foggy to plan; questions depend on unanswered questions | `flow-map` |
| Decisions settled, need writing down | `flow-spec` |
| Spec or settled conversation needs tasks (even one) | `flow-break` |
| Bug neither small nor a hotfix | `flow-break`: one `bugfix` task, behind a spike if the cause is unknown (§8) |
| Task file ready to build | `flow-implement` |
| A task is `blocked`, or the spec or task proved wrong | replan (below) |
| Review finished work | `flow-verify` |
| Last task of an effort with a spec has landed | `flow-close` |
| Code expensive to change | `flow-architect` |

When two apply, take the earliest incomplete. The user may skip ahead, but complex
work is always built from a task file: it carries the Base commit, Check and archive.

**Who starts a skill.** `flow-start`, `flow-grill`, `flow-map`, `flow-spec`,
`flow-break`, `flow-implement` and `flow-verify` may be entered when the routing
table sends you there. `flow-close`, `flow-architect` and `flow-break` amend change
records other sessions read, so start them only when the user asks, or say in one
line that you are starting one and why before you do.

**Replan.** A plan that turns out wrong is fixed in the plan, not worked around in
code. The task that hit it gets `Status: blocked` and a `## Blocked` section
(`flow-implement` writes both). Then `flow-grill` if the fix needs a user decision,
otherwise update the spec directly (with a decision entry per §1.2); then `flow-break`
in amend mode reviews every remaining task of the effort, since all may be stale.

---

## 6. Lifecycle

Every status has one owner, who writes it in the same change as the work that
justified it.

| Object | States | Who moves it |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Map `maps/<slug>.md` | `charting` → `working` → `clear` | `flow-map`: `working` once the first question is answered, `clear` when no question or fog is left |
| Spec `specs/<effort>.md` (the effort's state) | `proposed` → `in progress` → `done` | `flow-spec` writes `proposed`; `flow-implement` sets `in progress` when the effort's first task starts, and sets it back from `done` when a later task joins a closed effort; `flow-close` sets `done` |
| Task `tasks/<effort>/<NN>-<slug>.md` | drafted → `active` → (`paused` or `blocked`) → archived | `flow-break` drafts it (no `Status`); `flow-implement` sets `active` on start, `paused` when the session stops early (handoff below), `blocked` when the plan is wrong (§5); `flow-break` amend clears `blocked`; `flow-implement` archives it and drops `Status` |
| Debt entry in `technical-debt.md` | listed → removed | `flow-architect` (or any skill that finds one) adds it; the fixing task deletes it in its commit; if the user declines, delete it and append a decision entry (`Decided: not fixing <symptom>`, `Mine: no`) so reviews don't re-propose it |

An effort without a spec has no status: it is done when its last task lands, with no
`flow-close`. Under `local-merge` and `pr` a started task's file, with its `Status`,
`## Progress` and `## Blocked`, lives on the task branch until it lands; `next` reads
task branches, so claimed, paused and blocked tasks show from the main branch
(`merge-strategy.md`). `next` never offers a started task as ready; resume a `paused`
one before starting anything new.

**Reopening a closed effort.** An effort whose spec says `done` can still gain work:
a follow-up, a bug the effort caused, a fix too big for the close. Adding a task to
it sets the spec back to `in progress` in the same commit, so no task is ever open
under a settled spec. The next `flow-close` runs the new tasks' checks and appends a
`## Reopened <date>` section to the retrospective instead of rewriting it; the
history of what the effort originally shipped stays readable. A large piece of
follow-up work is a new effort instead, with its own spec.

**Pause handoff.** The resuming session never saw this one. Before setting
`Status: paused`, `## Progress` says: what is done, the next concrete step, open review
findings, the branch or worktree, and where uncommitted work is (in the tree, or a
stash named `<effort>/<NN> paused`). A next session that would need this conversation
means the handoff is incomplete.

---

## 7. Review

Shared by every review path (`flow-verify`, `flow-implement`, `flow-close`, the fast
paths); skills point here. What to look for lives in the `workflow-reviewer` brief.

**Security pass.** Runs whenever a change touches authentication, authorisation, input
reaching a query or shell, secrets, file paths, or another trust boundary, on every
path and every `flow-implement` level. Use a security-review agent if the
harness has one, else a subagent briefed for it. When it doesn't apply, say so in one
line.

**The reviewer classifies** each finding `blocking` or `nonblocking`; that label
stands.

**Only the user waives a blocking finding.** It is fixed, or the user accepts it in a
decision entry with `Mine: no`. A nonblocking finding the agent rejects gets a
`Mine: yes` entry, so the next review doesn't raise it again.

**Fixes get rechecked, sized to the fix.** Before fixing, stage the reviewed state
(`git add -- <the task's paths>`), so `git diff` plus the task's new files is exactly
the fix. A fix that stays in the lines the finding named is
rechecked by running the thing that was wrong; one that touches another file or
changes more than about 30 lines goes back to the same reviewer role with only that
delta.

**Findings are kept.** Each blocking finding and its outcome (fixed, or accepted with
the decision heading) goes into the task's `## Progress`, so `flow-close` can see
patterns.

---

## 8. Fixing bugs

Every bug outside a hotfix, on the fast path or as a `bugfix` task:

1. **Reproduce.** Make it fail and record how (command, input, output). If you can't
   reproduce it, say what you tried; it is not ready to fix.
2. **Pin it with a failing check.** The smallest test or script that fails because of
   the bug: the task's `Check`, or the proof on the fast path.
3. **Name the root cause.** One or two sentences on why the code does the wrong thing,
   in `## Progress` (commit body on the fast path). Patching a symptom with the cause
   unknown is a hotfix (§4).
4. **Fix the cause, then look sideways.** Check every other caller and copy of the
   faulty rule; the sibling path is the usual second bug.
5. **Watch the check go green,** then run the real path once. Still red? Revert that
   fix and go back to step 3: a fix stacked on a wrong fix hides the cause. Two
   failed attempts on the same bug mean the cause is still unknown: stop, and make
   finding it a `spike` as below.

**The second of a kind buys a check.** When the same class of bug is fixed twice in
`maintenance` or on the fast path, add the check that would have caught it — a test,
a lint rule, a CI step — in that same change, instead of waiting for `flow-close`
(§5, which a small task never reaches).

Cause still unknown after reproducing? Finding it is a `spike` task ("what causes
<symptom>?", time box stated as what to stop after); the fix task is `Blocked by` it.
